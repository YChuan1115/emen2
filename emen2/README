To get started:

cvs co emen2

Install BDB, Haili's version of the BDB-Python module, and Twisted.

Edit TwistServer.py and change the directory path (point to an empty directory somewhere).
Also change the path to the tweb directory.

run 'TwistServer.py'

This will provide a HTML and XMLRPC server on port 8080.

Point your browser at it and log in. Currently, every time you run the
server an administrative account is set up with username 'root' and
password 'foobar'. This is strictly for testing.

If you wish to play with python-level access to the database, you
can also  (after fixing the paths in test.py)

python
from test import *

This will provide 'db', the database object. You could then, for example:

ctxid=db.login("root","foobar")
print db.getparamdefnames()
